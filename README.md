# npm-package-cheatsheets

I've been using lots of different toosl, and trying to keep an eye on what works etc is just hard.

Every time I write a little script to check something out, I'll document it here.

It also gives me the opportunity to do the nice things, like using package.json scripts a bit better.

To run these, you should be able to just download, and type:

npm run qa

This will clean up any previous dependency stuff, do an install, run the tests, and do a lint on the code.
