# npm-package-cheatsheets

I've been using lots of different tools, and trying to keep an eye on what works etc is just hard. For instance shouldjs has the form deepEqual, and lodash has form cloneDeep.

There are also many different forms of the libraries, and I just need somewhere to keep it.

Every time I write a little script to check something out, I'll document it here.

It also gives me the opportunity to do the nice things, like using `package.json` scripts a bit better.

To run these, you should be able to just download, and type:

`npm run qa`

This will clean up any previous dependency stuff, do an install, run the tests, and do a lint on the code.

Things I'm using that may end up here:

 - bluebird
 - lodash
 - should
 - mocha
 - native js
 - mongoose
 - mongodb
